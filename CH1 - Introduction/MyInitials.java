// =============== LAB SUMMARY ===============

/*
1. What was the hardest part of this lab?
    The hardest part of this assignment is trying to make a the initials to look exactly like the Letter, 
    adjusting its indention, spaces, and structure of how it will look like in the output.

2. What will you always remember (never forget) from this exercise?
    I have learned that static is to define the block of a code to be able to get accessed from other code. its basically like "Hey can i have that?"
    and then they ask you if its static or not, if its static yes you can, if its not static then you cannot have it.

    Also there are different types of print, from what i learned on this lecture. println prints a statement labeled inside the parenthesis,
    and inside the parenthesis's content ("") to create the content or statement in a new line. For print, it does not create a new line but rather
    stack them in the new line.

    also adding \n creates a space below the statement.
