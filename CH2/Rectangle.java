// =============== LAB SUMMARY ===============

/*
1. What was the hardest part of this lab?
    I thought that by method, it means another method instead of doing the usual System.out.Println(" "); method.
    I found out that doing the usual method was way more easier and understandable than doing the math method which i 
    dont even know how i did it. it took me 3 days to understand how to do it.

2. What will you always remember (never forget) from this exercise?
    Using the easiest, fastiest, and most understandable code is the best technique and tricks when programming in order your
    code to be able to be comprehensible and understandable. To make your brain lessen the stress of reading something that is
    hard to read.
